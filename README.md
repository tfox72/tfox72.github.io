I have begun to create this Github Page to show samples of work. Due to the sensitive nature of my projects at work I will have to create sample notebooks. Currently all of the view buttons link to the same site as the docs. I will update once the new sample files have been created. In the meantime please check out the building blocks here. https://tfox72.github.io/index.html

Thanks!!
